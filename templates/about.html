<h1>About</h1>
    <p>These tools are being developed by <a href="https://oceanexpert.org/expert/erlawrence" target="_blank">Elizabeth Lawrence</a> from <a href="https://obis.org" target="_blank">OBIS</a>, produced as part of outcomes from the <a href="https://www.bioecocean.org/" target="_blank">BioEcoOcean</a> Horizon Europe project. AI (ChatGPT-4 and -5) was used to assist with the development and all code generated was reviewed, tested, and edited as necessary before being implemented.</p>
    <p>Metadata about data producers ultimately should be visible in ODIS and the GOOS BioEco Portal. BioEco EOV data should be published to OBIS, which requires it to be formatted according to the Darwin Core standard. This tool is designed to facilitate the process of creating metadata and data files that are compliant with these standards.</p>

    <p>See the following GitHub repos for details about the app development and where submitted entries are hosted on GitHub.</p>
